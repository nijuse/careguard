# CareGuard

**An autonomous AI agent that manages elderly healthcare spending on Stellar.**

Compares medication prices across pharmacies, audits medical bills for errors, checks drug interactions, and executes real USDC payments — all within caregiver-controlled spending policies. Every transaction settles on Stellar testnet via x402 and MPP.


---

## The Problem

**63 million American caregivers** spend $7,200/year out of pocket and 27 hours/week managing their aging parents' healthcare:

- Same medication costs **10x different** at pharmacies 2 miles apart
- **80% of medical bills** contain errors — average $1,300 overcharge on bills over $10K
- Only **0.1%** of denied insurance claims get appealed
- **71% of caregivers** are financially struggling

There is no tool that autonomously discovers the cheapest options, catches billing errors, and handles payments — with guardrails a caregiver can trust.

## How CareGuard Works

CareGuard is an AI agent with a Stellar wallet that acts on behalf of a family caregiver:

1. **Compares medication prices** across 5 pharmacies per drug — pays $0.002/query via x402 on Stellar
2. **Checks drug interactions** before ordering — pays $0.001/check via x402
3. **Orders medications** from the cheapest pharmacy — pays via MPP Charge on Stellar (real USDC)
4. **Audits medical bills** for duplicates, upcoding, overcharges — pays $0.01/audit via x402
5. **Pays corrected bill amounts** via direct Stellar USDC transfer
6. **Enforces spending policies** — daily/monthly limits, category budgets, caregiver approval thresholds

Every payment is a real Stellar testnet transaction verifiable on [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet).

### USE CASE: Maria & Rosa

> Maria lives 800 miles from her 78-year-old mother Rosa. Rosa takes 4 medications from 3 pharmacies. Last month, Rosa's blood pressure medication cost $47 at CVS — $12 at Costco, 2 miles away. Nobody knew.
>
> Rosa's hospital sent a $2,500 bill with $1,195 in errors — duplicate charges and upcoded procedures. Rosa would have paid it.
>
> **CareGuard found $69.76/month in medication savings and caught $1,195 in billing errors — for $0.03 in agent API costs.**

### Payment Protocols Used

| Protocol | Purpose | How It Works |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **x402** | Agent pays for API queries (pharmacy prices, bill audits, drug interactions) | Agent calls x402-protected endpoint → gets 402 → signs Stellar auth entry → OZ Facilitator settles payment → agent receives data |
| **MPP Charge** | Agent pays pharmacies for medication orders | Agent orders medication → gets 402 challenge → signs Stellar payment tx → server broadcasts → order confirmed |
| **Stellar USDC Transfer** | Agent pays medical bills | Agent builds Stellar payment tx → signs with keypair → submits to Horizon → USDC transferred |

### Services

| Service | Port | Protocol | Price |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| Pharmacy Price API | 3001 | x402 | $0.002/query |
| Bill Audit API | 3002 | x402 | $0.01/audit |
| Drug Interaction API | 3003 | x402 | $0.001/check |
| AI Agent | 3004 | REST | — |
| Pharmacy Payment | 3005 | MPP Charge | per-order |
| Dashboard | 3000 | Next.js | — |

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22 or later, npm.

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for the full setup guide.

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/harystyleseze/careguard
cd careguard
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Create testnet wallets
npm run setup

# 3. Configure .env (see .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
# Add: OZ_FACILITATOR_API_KEY, LLM_API_KEY, fund agent with testnet USDC

# 4. Start all services
npm run dev

# 5. Start dashboard (separate terminal)
cd dashboard && npm run dev

# 6. Open http://localhost:3000
```

> **Note:** `data/` is a **local working directory**. Spending snapshots, transaction logs, and orders contain medication lists, spending patterns, and wallet activity — they are excluded from version control by `.gitignore` and must never be committed. See `docs/adr/002-pii-in-persistence.md` for details.

### Docker dev (one command)

For a single-command boot of the full stack — server, dashboard, redis, prometheus, grafana — use Docker Compose. See [issue #111](https://github.com/harystyleseze/careguard/issues/111).

```bash
# 1. Configure .env (same as above)
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Start everything
docker compose up

# 3. Open the apps
#   Dashboard:  http://localhost:3000
#   Server:     http://localhost:3004
#   Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
#   Grafana:    http://localhost:3030  (admin / admin by default)
#   Redis:      localhost:6379
```

The default `docker-compose.yml` builds the production-shape multi-stage images. The auto-loaded `docker-compose.override.yml` swaps the `server` and `dashboard` services for hot-reload dev mode (mounts the source tree, runs `npm run dev`).

To run the prod-shape stack without the dev overrides:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

To tear everything down (including volumes — drops the spending log, redis data, grafana dashboards):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Health checks are enabled on every service. Targets:

| Service     | Health probe                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `server`    | `GET /` returns 200                           |
| `dashboard` | `GET /` returns 200                           |
| `redis`     | `redis-cli ping` returns PONG                 |
| `prometheus`| `GET /-/ready`                                |
| `grafana`   | `GET /api/health`                             |

Boot time on a warm Docker is ~30s (cold first build is much longer due to npm install). If the dashboard waits forever for `server: healthy`, check `docker compose logs server` — the most common cause is missing/invalid `OZ_FACILITATOR_API_KEY` or `AGENT_SECRET_KEY` in `.env`.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pnpm install

# Run all tests (root backend + dashboard)
pnpm test

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test -- --coverage
```

Tests are organized in two workspaces:

- **Root workspace** – backend tests for `agent/`, `services/`, `shared/`, `scripts/` (Node environment)
- **Dashboard workspace** – frontend tests for `dashboard/src/` (jsdom environment via `dashboard/vitest.config.ts`)

Shared test helpers (environment scrubber, fetch mock, Horizon mock) live in `tests/setup.ts`.

## Verified Results

From real end-to-end test on Stellar testnet:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Medication savings found | **$69.76/month** ($837/year) |
| Billing errors caught | **$1,195** (47.8% of bill) |
| Agent x402 API cost | **$0.030** |
| Agent wallet USDC spent | **$7.53** (medications + bills + API fees) |
| Tool calls (autonomous) | **17** per full task |
| Stellar transactions | All verifiable on [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet) |

**Cost breakdown:** 10 price queries @ $0.002 = $0.02, 1 drug interaction check @ $0.001 = $0.001, 1 bill audit @ $0.01 = $0.01. Total: $0.030 in autonomous AI agent operational costs.

## Why CareGuard

### Application of Technology
Uses x402 (per-query API payments) + MPP Charge (medication orders) + direct Stellar USDC transfers (bill payments) + spending policy engine — each payment protocol in its appropriate context.

### Business Value
63M caregivers, $7,200/yr out of pocket, $220B medical debt, 80% of bills have errors. CareGuard saves Rosa $2,320 in year one for $0.03 in API costs.
